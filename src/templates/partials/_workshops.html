            <h3>Advanced React (April 10)</h3>
            <p>
              Writing applications with React is awesome. But sometimes creating reusable components can be a bit of a trick. And knowing the right level of abstraction and what libraries to use can be frustratingly difficult. Luckily for us, React is constantly getting better. Making React components that can be used in multiple places is not hard. What is hard is when the use cases differ. Without the right patterns, you can find yourself with a highly complex component that requires a lot of configuration props and way too many if statements. With this course, you'll not only learn great patterns you can use, but also the strengths and weaknesses of each so you know which to reach for to provide your components the flexibility and power you need. We'll also take a look at how to use React's built-in state management capabilities to solve common problems for production applications in elegant and simple ways.
              <br/>
              I have contributed to and published some of the most successful React components in the React ecosystem. Through that experience, I've learned and taught patterns that enhance flexibility, usefulness, and simplicity. I've taught thousands of developers how to be more effective with React. Join us!

            <h3>Design Systems for React Developers (April 10)</h3>
            <p>
              Development of digital products is a complex process that involves multiple stakeholders and roles: managers, designers, engineers, QA, and customers. This increases the communication overhead, slows down the process, and oftentimes results and less than ideal user experience.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>- How to communicate design ideas between different stakeholders effectively?</li>
              <li>- How to deliver consistent UI without constant supervising?</li>
              <li>- How to ensure same problems not being solved multiple times?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Design systems offer a systematic approach to the process of product creation. This approach establishes an organization-wide design language that can be backed into a UI library and the styleguide and becomes the single source of truth for the entire organization. Component libraries and living styleguides encourage reuse, promote consistency, improve team productivity, help to identify common patterns and solve similar problems only once.</p>

            <h3>Advanced React (April 10)</h3>
            <p>
              Full-day, hands-on coding workshop to explore advanced patterns and new features in React. React may be just a simple UI library, but it involves a pretty big ecosystem around it. Explaining the basics and internals is not enough, so in this module we're going to explain the best practices, we're going to learn to "think in React", and apply solutions to real problems that you might encounter in the process of building an app.
            </p>
            <p>We'll explore all the advanced techniques for making flexible and maintainable React components. We'll see how using popular patterns like Higher Order Components, Compound Components, Render Props etc. can help us in simplifying things, making our components more reusable and our apps more declarative.</p>
            <p>React 16 comes with some major changes and an update to the core algorithm. In this module, we'll explore some practical use-cases for Hooks, Portals, Fragments, Error Boundaries etc. We'll see how the new Context API can simplify state-management and we'll play with a new feature called react-call-return.</p>

            <p>
              The JavaScript Eco System is moving to TypeScript. Fast. TypeScript has some unique, very powerful features that fit very well with the dynamic nature of the JavaScript language. This workshop will get you up and running with all the basics and the most important advanced patterns of TypeScript.</p>
            <p>But beyond that, this is a workshop for React devs! So we will discuss extensively how to combine TypeScript with a React code base. To practice the theory, during the hands-on parts of this workshop we will be migrating an application from plain JavaScript to TypeScript.

            <p>
              Developing and deploying production applications with React is one thing, but being confident that you're not shipping a hidden bug is something else! Knowing how to configure and use testing tools is critical to your success in shipping with confidence, and React's model opens up testing productivity most of us couldn't even dream of before.
              <br/>
              I have personally written tens of thousands of tests for production applications and my open source modules. Thousands of developers have improved their testing knowledge from my testing training material.

            <p>
              This one-day workshop will teach you everything you need to know to incorporate GraphQL into your application. During the first half of the workshop, we'll explain the basics of a GraphQL and we’re gonna build a GraphQL server, covering best practices for architecting your schema, error handling, authentication, and permission layers.
              <br/>
              In the second half of the workshop, we’ll connect our GraphQL server to a React application with Apollo Client. We’ll break down the modular architecture of the client and teach you how to set everything up and use queries and mutations. We’ll show a few different approaches for working with Apollo: Higher Order Components, Render Props, and hooks. Throughout the course of the workshop, you’ll learn practical tips for using GraphQL in production.

              Before the workshop, please follow the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started" target="_blank">installation instructions</a> to prepare all the software dependencies. macOS devices are preferred, but *nix and Windows powered machines would also work, although you won't be able to build iOS applications.
              No React Native knowledge is required. Participants should be familiar with Javascript and ideally, basics of React.
