                  <p class="workshop-info__p">
                    Writing applications with React is awesome. But sometimes creating reusable components can be a bit of a trick. And knowing the right level of abstraction and what libraries to use can be frustratingly difficult. Luckily for us, React is constantly getting better. Making React components that can be used in multiple places is not hard. What is hard is when the use cases differ. Without the right patterns, you can find yourself with a highly complex component that requires a lot of configuration props and way too many if statements. With this course, you'll not only learn great patterns you can use, but also the strengths and weaknesses of each so you know which to reach for to provide your components the flexibility and power you need. We'll also take a look at how to use React's built-in state management capabilities to solve common problems for production applications in elegant and simple ways.<br>

I have contributed to and published some of the most successful React components in the React ecosystem. Through that experience, I've learned and taught patterns that enhance flexibility, usefulness, and simplicity. I've taught thousands of developers how to be more effective with React. Join us!</p>

                    Developing and deploying production applications with React is one thing, but being confident that you're not shipping a hidden bug is something else! Knowing how to configure and use testing tools is critical to your success in shipping with confidence, and React's model opens up testing productivity most of us couldn't even dream of before.<br>

I have personally written tens of thousands of tests for production applications and my open source modules. Thousands of developers have improved their testing knowledge from my testing training material.</p>

                  <p class="workshop-info__p">
                    This one-day workshop will teach you everything you need to know to incorporate GraphQL into your application.
During the first half of the workshop, we'll explain the basics of a GraphQL and we’re gonna build a GraphQL server,
covering best practices for architecting your schema, error handling, authentication, and permission layers. <br>
                    In the second half of the workshop, we’ll connect our GraphQL server to a React application with Apollo Client.
We’ll break down the modular architecture of the client and teach you how to set everything up and use queries and mutations.
We’ll show a few different approaches for working with Apollo: Higher Order Components, Render Props, and hooks.
Throughout the course of the workshop, you’ll learn practical tips for using GraphQL in production.
